After reading Baker’s article I found that even with the feeling of being an outsider at basically every job she had, she kept pushing forward in her career and didn’t just give up. She moved all over the country for work and still was unable to find a job that treated her as she should have been treated. I was surprised that even when she did try to “fit in” with her coworkers she was still overlooked, stereotyped, and harassed.

A new employee should have some flexibility when entering a new workplace. If the employer wants things done a certain way then it’s the employee’s responsibility to apply the employer’s way things are done. If a job requires you to write code in PHP then you shouldn’t try submitting work written in Python or Ruby for example. I think that an employee’s personal views or traits shouldn’t be things that have to change if they do not cause a problem in the workplace. If an employee feels that being late three days a week is not a big deal then that would be something that would need to change to keep their job. A person’s religious beliefs or sexual orientation on the other hand should not be required to change just to keep a job unless, of course, it somehow causes an issue with their work or in the workplace.
